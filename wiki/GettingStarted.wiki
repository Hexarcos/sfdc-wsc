= Force.com Web Service Connector (WSC) =

The Force.com Web Service Connector (WSC) is a high performing web service client stack 
implemented using a streaming parser. WSC also makes it much easier to use the Force.com 
API (Web Services/SOAP or Asynchronous/REST API).  WSC can be used to invoke any doc 
literal wrapped web service.

== Downloading WSC ==

You can download a pre-built WSC jar file from:

http://code.google.com/p/sfdc-wsc/downloads/list

== Building WSC from Source Code == 

1. Download the source code from:
     http://code.google.com/p/sfdc-wsc/source/checkout

2. cd to dist directory.

3. run "ant all" to generate the wsc.jar file.


== Generating Stub Code from a WSDL == 

Run wsdlc on the WSDL you have downloaded:

 java -classpath wsc.jar com.sforce.ws.tools.wsdlc *wsdl* *jar.file*

   * *wsdl* is the name of the WSDL file
   * *jar.file* is the name of the output jar file that wsdlc generates
   * You can include an optional argument: -Dpackage-prefix=*myprefix*

== Write application code ==
Write your client application. For example, the following code creates a new Account using partner API:

{{{

   import com.sforce.soap.partner.*;
   import com.sforce.soap.partner.sobject.*;
   import com.sforce.ws.*;

   public static void main(String args) {
              ConnectorConfig config = new ConnectorConfig();
              config.setUsername("username");
              config.setPassword("password");

              PartnerConnection connection = Connector.newConnection(config);
              SObject account = new SObject();
              account.setType("Account");
              account.setField("Name", "My Account");
              connection.create(new SObject[]{account});
   }

}}}

Add wsc.jar and *jar.file* (generated by wsdlc) to your classpath, then compile and run your client application.
